      Hello everybody. Before I begin, I would like to say that I am thrilled to
      be a part of this event. I have spent a lot of my time since 2012 teaching
      designers and artists to code, and it is really wonderful to see an event
      like this happen. I am hosting Processing Community Day Copenhagen next
      weekend, so I am hoping to learn a lot of stuff and meet a lot of
      interesting people today. So a big thanks to Joel and the team for
      inviting me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have called this talk Programming Design Systems, because I want to
      primarily talk about the book by the same name that I’m currently writing
      about the intersection between graphic design and programming languages.
    </p>

      But first, let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Rune Madsen, and I
      first of foremost think of myself as a designer who just happens to use
      programming languages to build the kind of products that I care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work tends to span a few categories, from the more artistic
      installation and gallery work, to the professional (I used to work at the
      New York Times and as a Creative Director for O’Reilly Media), and I have
      been teaching at New York University since 2012, recently for three
      semesters in Shanghai. But I think the common thread in all of this is the
      merging of design and code.

      I recently co-founded what we call a deeply technical design studio named
      <a href="https://designsystems.international"
        >Design Systems International</a
      >
      with my talented designer friend
      <a href="https://twitter.com/brvmrtn">Martin Bravo</a>, where we work
      hands-on with many of the ideas that I’m going to talk about today. I will
      show some of our work at the end also.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is a little bit about me. Before I begin, I was wondering if we
      can do a quick headcount. How many of you have tried programming before?
      How many of you are students? And how many of you consider yourself
      designers? Thanks a lot, that is always good to know.

      I want to begin by spending some time talking about why I am writing this
      book. From 2012 to 2018, I was teaching at the Interactive
      Telecommunications Program (also called ITP), which is an almost 40-year
      old graduate program at New York University that very much shares the same
      values as the Processing Foundation: To make learning how to program
      accessible to communities that normally do not feel included or think of
      themselves as technical. It is a very diverse graduate program both in age
      groups and in the fields represented, and we are proud that the student
      body is majority women – which is rare for a program focused on
      programming languages and electronics. It is also home to Daniel Shiffman
      from the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw"
        >Coding Train YouTube channel</a
      >
      who some of you might know.

    <p>
      The way we think about the computer at ITP is quite different than that of
      a traditional engineering program. We teach hard skills, but only because
      our students need them in order to make the kind of creative projects they
      care about: They want to learn P5.js so they can make an animated comic,
      or they want to learn Processing so they can make a generative poster that
      looks different every time you print it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like this approach because in this way, programming languages
      become just another tool, a very powerful tool, that enable us to produce
      creative projects. And it gets us away from a world where we separate
      people into technical people who can program the computer on the one side
      and creative people who use their hands on the other side.

      So if you are a painter and you were trained to use a bunch of tools such
      as pigments, brushes, pencils, charcoal, there is no reason why you should
      not also learn how to program and see where this takes you creatively. So
      we really try to lower the barriers to entry for people who normally don’t
      consider themselves programmers. This also gives me a chance to show my
      talented friend Alex Dodge, who uses lasercut stencils created from
      generative 3D models to create these very graphic, almost graphic
      design-like, paintings.

      However, one thing that has struck me watching students get introduced to
      programming languages is that computers are such a powerful tool that if
      we don not really keep our eyes on it, the computer ends up taking all our
      focus.

    <p>
      If we assume that every creative project is (in simple terms) made up of
      the why (the concept or the content) and the how (the design or the form),
      the creative coding community (or whatever we should call it) tends to
      focus a whole lot on the how.

      This means that we spend a lot of time on what a thing looks like and how
      it is made, and very little time asking why it should even exist in the
      world. I began noticing this in my classroom where students would mostly
      comment on the technical sufficiency and visual style of a project, and
      rarely on the concept. I think that is a very natural thing when you are
      introduced to a powerful tool, but it also means that we completely lose
      our connection to fine arts education.

      ... or seen this monoculture of dance performances with motion-enabled
      projections that makes you wonder whether it is us using the computer or
      it is the computer using us, you know what I mean. It is not that these
      projects are bad, but I do not get much satisfaction from them.

      I guess uou can compare it to the new Marvel movies. I wondered for a long
      time why they are unbearable for me to watch. I recently heard Douglas
      Rushkoff say in podcast about another TV-show,
      <em
        >“It went through me like cheese doodles. It’s constructed for me to
        keep eating it […], but it actually doesn’t deliver any nutrition”</em
      >. So I wanted to teach a class that could teach code and concept at the
      same time.

      So why focus on graphic design? I think there are many reasons why such a
      book should exist.

      My primary reason is that what graphic design products looked like 25
      years ago is not at all what they are today. We used to live in a world of
      static design products where the word <em>design</em> described most of
      the production process. If you are making a poster, the final product is
      really not that much different from the proposed design.

    <p>
      But today most design products are digital and created in software, and
      the visual design is just a small part of what makes up the design
      product.

      What makes a digital design product good is, yes the visual design, but
      also all the things that make it come alive: animations, loading of live
      data, haptic feedback, etc. And the problem is that none of this can be
      designed in a traditional graphic design tool. All of this requires the
      use of programming.

      If you look at the tools that graphic designers use, it is apparent that
      it is a field built on manual work. Most of the tools in Photoshop,
      Illustrator, or sketch are entirely modelled on manual processes that came
      before the computer: The crop tool, the marquee tool. Even though you are
      doing it with the mouse, it is still a manual drawing process. So we know
      that traditional design tools are very bad at prototyping complex systems.

  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      So if you insist that designers should only use traditional design tools,
      you end up defining design as a very small part of what it means to make
      something.

      You would think that design schools would understand that this is
      happening and change their curriculum to keep teaching what they are good
      at, but expand their toolset to include new technologies. Unfortunately
      what seems to happen is that many design schools find it too hard to teach
      code, so they double down on this idea that designers should be creative
      people who come up with ideas, and then more technical people should
      implement them. I think that is really unfortunate because it leaves us
      with an educational system where the design schools teach conceptual
      thinking but in a frame of mind where the designer is someone who makes
      posters and book covers, and technical schools that teach code but not
      conceptual thinking. I am off course generalising here, because there are
      many amazing art+technology schools, but I do think that a common problem
      here is that there is no foundational book that thinks about graphic
      design (shape, color, typography, layout, etc) in terms of programming
      languages.

  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <p>
      And that is really fristrating because the history of graphic design is
      full of books applying systems and rules to the design process. Even
      before the computer, designers were using algorithms to help them design
      better, so I find it particularly odd that the field of graphic design has
      not embraced these new tools.
